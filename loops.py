########NOTES FOR LOOPS##########################
#for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times you can iterate over a reange, string, sequenece. 

# for x in (range(1,11,2)): # reversed(range(1,11)) will count backwords (x,x,x) the third number will make it count in twos
#     print(x)

# credit_card= "1234-5678-9012-3456"
# for x in credit_card:
#     print(x)
#######################################
#iterate means LOOP

# for x in range(1,21):
#     if x==13:
#         break  #contiune basically skip that varaible # Break stops the code at that number
#     else:
#         print(x)
